The app is a kind of simple war simulator.

You have an army, you have territory, territory gives you money, you get more territory from winning battles against
players who own other territory.

Money can be used to buy superior units.

There's different types of units with different strengths and weaknesses that synergise differently with
other units.

Buying units, battling, choosing a territory to battle, displaying other players all work

As far as I can tell nothing doesn't work

If I had unlimited time I'd add some variety of PvE to the game as right now it is stricly PvP
Although the game doesn't punish new players, it might be hard for new players to get a foothold.

Maybe I could have separated the game into leagues by how powerful the players are.
But those are all balance issues

The battles have been balanced, but probably not perfectly, there's 6 types of unit right now.
Balancing every combination of units would likely be a job that would never be possible to complete.

The thing I learned the most is that when designing something like this, the ratio of effort you put in
to what you get out is crazy, github says that including bootstrap there's 12,000 lines of code. That's crazy

There's probably quite a bit of redundant code in there, things like bootstrap templates were taken from
previous projects of mine and some code was taken from my code library from previous projects.

I have tried to remove as much redundant code as possible, but I'm sure I missed some, I don't remember using Jquery or captchas at all... But The linked files are still sitting there, also I think I have 2 Bootstraps now...
